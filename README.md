Loudly
======
Loudly is an application that can play music (only .wav files) right from your PC on your Android devices. 
On your PC, you have to start Java server and pick a song, while on your mobile device you have to connect to 
the server IP. If the IP displayed in server console is not right, you can use ipconfig in your command line tool. 
After you click "Play" in the app, the mobile device starts listening for the song from server. 
If you want to start playing song, you have to click "Play" on the server aswell.
The server can stream music to multiple devices at the same time. Android client uses library actionbarsherlock which you can download from http://actionbarsherlock.com/ 


This app is still a work in progress, we have several features and problems which we plan to solve and develop in future.

If you wish to try Loudly, you can download the jar server file from here:
